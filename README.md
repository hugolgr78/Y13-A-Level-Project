This was my Year 13 A-Level project (2022) done entirely in Unity and C#. Altough it is not complete, it still includes:
- A playable character with animations
- Many enemies with animations and attacks
- A brief mission
- A skills tree to upgrade the player
- An inventory for the player
- Two bosses with animations and attacks (Sand elemental and Dark Mage)
- Melee and Ranged enemies
- Potions, health, currency

The documentation is included and requires to be downloaded as it is a large file
