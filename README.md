# Year 13 A-Level Project (2022) - Unity and C#  

This project, developed during my Year 13 A-Levels, was built entirely in **Unity** using **C#**. Although it was not completed to its full extent, it demonstrates several core features of a role-playing game, showcasing my skills in game development, character design, and gameplay mechanics.  

## 🎯 Key Features  
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Playable Character with Animations**: Control a character with smooth animations for movement and actions.  
- 👹 **Various Enemies**: Includes 16 enemies with animations and unique attack patterns.  
- 🎮 **Playable Mission**: A brief mission where the player can experience key gameplay elements.  
- 🌲 **Skill Tree**: Upgrade the player's abilities through a detailed skill tree system.  
- 🛠️ **Inventory System**: Manage items such as weapons, potions, and currency in an intuitive inventory.  
- 🏹 **Two Bosses**: Fight against two challenging bosses, the **Sand Elemental** and **Dark Mage**, each with their own animations and attacks.  
- ⚔️ **Melee and Ranged Enemies**: A variety of enemy types that require different strategies to defeat.  
- 🧪 **Potions, Health, and Currency**: Collect and use potions, maintain health, and manage currency to progress.  

## 📚 Documentation  
- The project includes detailed documentation that explains the game's design, mechanics, and implementation.
- The documentation does not include some features such as the skill tree as I continued working on the project briefly after my A-Levels.
- **Note**: The documentation file is large, so it needs to be downloaded separately.
